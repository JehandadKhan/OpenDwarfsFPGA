Baum-Welch Algorithm
===============

Status: Beta

The Baum-Welch algorithm falls into the graphical models dwarf and has
many applications, including bioinformatics, cryptanalysis and speech
recognition. It makes use of the forward-backward algorithm and finds
the unknown parameters of a hidden Markov model (HMM).

Running
-------

Usage: bwa_hmm [-p <platform> -d <device> | -t <type> --] (see examples below for available run parameters, while keeping some parameters fixed)

    <platform>	:integer ID of platform to use
    <device>    :integer ID of device in <platform> to use
    <type>		: device type to use (0:CPU, 1:GPU, 2:MIC, 3:FPGA)
    
Example:

Vary state with fixed S = 2, T = 1000
	$ ./bwa_hmm -n <number> -v n
Vary symbols with fixed N = 60, T = 1000
	$ ./bwa_hmm -s <number> -v s
Vary observations with fixed N = 60, T = 2
	$ ./bwa_hmm -t <number> -v t
