Temporal Data Mining
====================

Status: Alpha

The Temporal Data Mining(TDM) code is a restricted variant of association rule
data mining.  In this case, temporal data is also considered as part of the
association process.

Running
-------

Usage: tdm [<platform> <device> | <type> --] <filepath> <temporal constraints path> <threads>

    <temporal database>         :file containing temporal database (in csv format)
    <temporal constraints file> :file containing temporal constraints 
    <episodes file>				:file containing episode information 
    <threads>                   :maximum number of threads to use      
    <platform>                  :integer ID of platform to use
    <device>                    :integer ID of device in <platform> to use
    <type>						: device type to use (0:CPU, 1:GPU, 2:MIC, 3:FPGA)
